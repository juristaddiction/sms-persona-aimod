/** Column layout + SQL for the folder message rows: Spam & blocked → Messages
 *  and Trash → Messages.
 *
 *  Column [COL_NAME] is `c.name` — the contacts-resolved sender name (a saved
 *  contact's name, or the canonical address for unknown senders). The folder
 *  screens render that name and fall back to a formatted number only when it
 *  equals the address. Keeping the projection and the index contract here lets
 *  JUnit pin the mapping so a display number can't be smuggled into [COL_NAME]
 *  again. */
